#Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004)

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region,
but continental-scale measurements haven't previously been made.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which 
measuremenets in the literature can be applied at a regional
scale.
